        <h1>Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites</h1>
        <p>"HTML, which stands for <a href="Hypertext Markup Language">Hypertext Markup Language</a>, is the primary language of the World Wide Web. An HTML document 
            sets the content and structure of a web page. When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is 
            your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server
        </p>
        <p> HTML is almost always used 
            in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript. <a href="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</a> is a language 
            that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts. <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a programming language 
            that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.
        </p>
        <p>The most recent numbered 
            release of HTML is HTML5. Released in 2008, <a href="HTML5 notably contained">HTML5 notably contained</a> several improvements to handle multimedia 
            content like audio and video and <a href="semantically rich elements">semantically rich elements</a> to describe page structure.
        </p> 
        <p>Going forward, there 
            will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML. That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called 
            “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008.
        </p>
        <p>If 
            you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our <a href="ultimate guide to HTML">ultimate guide to HTML</a>. 
            You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p>Because every website is 
            written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a 
            good idea to immerse yourself in it. And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages 
            like PHP (such as <a href="WordPress">WordPress</a> ). With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query 
            the site's database to <a href="generate the finished HTML document">generate the finished HTML document</a> to deliver to visitors' browsers.
        </p>
            <p>You can take 
            any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life. Later in 
            this post, I’ll review some of the ways <a href="designers and developers">designers and developers</a> harness HTML in their creative works.

        <h1>A Few Ideas for HTML Websites</h1>
        <p>To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good idea for you to create 
            a website or two from scratch.Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML 
            works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some ideas for  <a href="">beginner-friendly simple HTML projects</a> you can create:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>A personal website.</b> Create a <a href="personal site">personal site</a> that shows off 
                <a href="your resume">your resume</a>, work experience, interests, 
                skills, and personality. You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.
            </li>
            <li><b>An informational site.</b> Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches 
                visitors about it. You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll 
                share some examples below.
            </li>
            <li><b>A small business website or a non-profit website.</b> You can volunteer to create a <a href="website for a small 
                local business">website for a small local business</a> in your area. Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.
            </li>
            <li><b>A blog.</b> While there are many great <a href="blogging platforms">blogging platforms</a> out there, consider making your own. A simple 
                HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
            </li>
            <li><b>A portfolio.</b> Want to <a href="show off your other creative works?">show off your other creative works?</a> 
                Try building a portfolio, be it a <a href="photo gallery">photo gallery</a>, a video showcase, or a <a href="collection of your writing">collection of your writing</a>. 
                The best part? We even have a <a href="step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML">step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial <a href="from freeCodeCamp">from freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>
   
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qz0aGYrrlhU" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="400px" aria-controls="" ></iframe>
   
        <p>As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, 
            more unique design choices. But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down 
            to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
        </p>
        <p>Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively. I’ll also help 
            unpack what makes them tick.

               </div>
    
    
                    <p> <b>What I like:</b> Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, 
                        Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website. While the hero section 
                        isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll 
                        down the page.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At first glance, this site may look technically complex. However, you can 
                        achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS. While there’s an occasional 
                        JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of 
                        this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> It’s worth 
                        digging into the page's source code if you’re curious. For example, when I checked out 
                        the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different 
                        HTML techniques that the site relies on.

                </div>
    
                    <p> <b>What I like:</b> Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s 
                        World website to connect with potential clients. Visitors start on a simple welcome 
                        screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various 
                        projects and learning more about his experience. I think it’s much more engaging 
                        than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails. And, given that 
                        Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he 
                        can do.
                    </p><br> 
                    <p> While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure 
                        HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript. Joshua also uses the Sanity 
                        content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>    Overall, I think 
                        that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce 
                        what your website is trying to achieve. Rather than just telling people about his 
                        skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
                    </p><br>

                </div>

                <p> What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source <a href="development framework">development framework</a> 
                    developers can use to build server-side web applications. The Ruby on Rails 
                    website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
                </p> <br>
                <p> especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its 
                    color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations. 
                    The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
                </p><br>
                <p> The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling. None of the effects 
                    that you see require JavaScript. For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates 
                    interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
                </p>    <br>
                <p> I think that it‘s a great reminder 
                    that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML 
                    website. Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with
                     engagement and storytelling (as many of my other examples show). However, 
                     they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.

                    I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time. It’s a

                    In particular, the website’s use of <a href="scalable vector graphic (SVG)">scalable vector graphic (SVG)</a> artwork is 
                    stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information. 
                    Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics. As far as 
                    online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.

        <h1>How to make your own  simple HTML Website</h1>

        <p>
            If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
        </p>

        <p>
            "While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:
        </p>

        <h2>
            Static HTML Website Generator
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
        </p>
        <p>
            "If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to <a href="use WordPress and a static site generator">use WordPress and a static site generator</a> plugin like <a href="Simply Static">Simply Static</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You can <a href="build your website with WordPress">build your website with WordPress</a>, including using <a href="WordPress themes">WordPress themes</a> to control the design of your site. You'll also still be able to use a lot of <a href="WordPress plugins">WordPress plugins</a> (though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site). Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Webflow (<a href="like WordPress">like WordPress</a>, it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)
            </li>
            <li>Jekyll</li>
            <li>Hugo</li>
            <li>Gridsome</li>
            <li>Eleventy</li>
            <li>Pelican</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use <a href="HTML code editors">HTML code editors</a> like <a href="Sublime Text">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="Atom">Atom</a> to build your website on your local computer. Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
        </p>
        <p>
            To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library. For example, I think <a href="the popular Bootstrap library">the popular Bootstrap library</a> makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components. This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.

        <p>
            "Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.

        <p>
            We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes. But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made. With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience.
